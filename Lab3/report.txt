My program read the file and sorts it using a linked list. I then generate an
array and destroy the linked list. The algorithms generate random numbers against
the required index of the median.

Based on the results, clearly algorithm 2 seems to find the median quicker.
That is because it gets rid of unwanted values for further iterations.

Both the dev/urandom and the rand() function take similar attempts to locate the
median.
